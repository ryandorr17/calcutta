# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#
# Create 40 users
#
#
# 40.times do |n|
#   name  = Faker::Name.name
#   email = Faker::Internet.email
#   password = "password"
#   User.create!(name:  name,
#                email: email,
#                password:              password,
#                password_confirmation: password,
#               )
# end



# create 10 Auctions



# Create 64 teams

# 64.times do |n|
#   name  = Faker::Company.name
#   order = n
#   seed = rand(1..16)
#   event_id = 1
#   Entrant.create!(name:  name,
#                order: order,
#                event_id:              event_id,
#                seed: seed,
#               )
# end
